# Golang Store Application

This project serves as a practical resource for grasping the foundational aspects of developing a web application in Go. It provides insights into the practical application of structs and demonstrates the seamless integration of Go with a local Postgres database, enabling comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Learning Topics

By studying this application, you can learn the following topics related to Go programming:

1. **Create a Web Application with Go:**: Get hands-on experience in creating a web application using the Go programming language.

2. **Server and Product Struct**: Understand how to set up the server and define the product struct for your web application.

3. **Connecting to Database - Postgres**: Learn how to connect your Go application to a local Postgres database, enabling data storage and retrieval.

4. **Refactoring and New Product Page**: Explore the process of refactoring code for improved maintainability and adding a new product page to your web application.

5. **Deleting Products and Partials**: Implement functionality to delete products and work with partials to enhance the user experience.

6. **Updating and Editing Products**: Enable users to update and edit product information within your Golang Store.

## Running the Application

To run the Golang Store application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official [Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

2. Make sure you have a local Postgres database set up and running.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the following command to start the application:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   This will execute the `main.go` script, which contains the Golang Store application. The application will start a server.

5. Check the Golang Store in your browser by navigating to the following address:

   [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

   Here, you can add, edit, and delete products in the Golang Store.

6. To stop the application and the server, use the Ctrl + C keyboard shortcut in the terminal or command prompt where the application is running.
